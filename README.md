# landing_page

This project aims to create a website landing page using HTML and CSS.
The skills used to create this landing page will be creating the HTML document and appropriate divs, classes and elements and using CSS to style them. 
Flexbox will be used to position these elements on the webpage as per the project brief. 


The website landing page was built using the skills learned in earlier sections of the Foundations course. 
As per the project brief the page is not intended to be responsive and fulfilled the assignment goals of creating an page that looked like the image provided.

Any images used in the project are my own.
